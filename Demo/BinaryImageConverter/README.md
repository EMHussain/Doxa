# BinaryImageConverter v1.0
## Introduction
BinaryImageConverter is a demo application showing how to use the [Δoxa Binarization Framework](https://github.com/brandonmpetty/Doxa) to create binary images.

**Algorithms**
* Niblack - "An Introduction to Digital Image Processing", 1986.
* Sauvola - "Adaptive document image binarization", 1999.
* Wolf - "Extraction and Recognition of Artificial Text in Multimedia Documents", 2003.
* Gatos - "Adaptive degraded document image binarization", 2005. (Partial)
* NICK - "Comparison of Niblack inspired Binarization methods for ancient documents", 2009.

**Native Image Support**
* Portable Any-Map: PBM (P4), 8-bit PGM (P5), PPM (P6), PAM (P7)

## Overview
The goal of this application is to show how easily one can create binary images using ΔBF.
You may specify one or more algorithms at a time, along with an optional Window Size and K-Value.
