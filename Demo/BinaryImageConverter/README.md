# BinaryImageConverter v2.0
## Introduction
BinaryImageConverter is a demo application showing how to use the [Δoxa Binarization Framework](https://github.com/brandonmpetty/Doxa) to create binary images.

## Overview
The goal of this application is to show how easily one can create binary images using ΔBF.
You may specify one or more algorithms at a time, along with an optional Window Size and K-Value.
